When a device isn’t capable of running Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) directly, it will typically pass its messages to another device called a gateway. This gateway will process and forward messages to and from the Internet.

Gateways help IoT devices stay small, battery-operated and inexpensive, because they typically handle multiple devices as a local base station. For example, here are some real-life scenarios:
Wearable devices running Bluetooth/BLE often use a mobile phone as their gateway to the Internet. This works well as long as the phone and the devices are nearby each other.
Home automation protocols such as Zigbee, Z-Wave and LoRaWAN can’t be handled by a mobile phone directly, nor would it make sense since mobile phones don’t stay in a fixed location. These protocols as well as proprietary ones typically use a gateway box plugged into wall power and either Ethernet, Wi-Fi or cellular. They receive information from devices using their native protocol, like Zigbee, process what they receive, and then forward it along over the Internet.
Industrial environments, such as solar fields and wind farms require a hardened industrial gateway to route communications from devices distributed across the remote device network, as shown in the following illustration.

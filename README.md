### Problem Statement - Why IoT Security Matters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In many industries, automotive and healthcare for example, there is an increasing reliance on IoT devices for day to day business. Unfortunately, there often is not a proportional investment of resources or funding to secure these devices. IoT devices are particularly vulnerable to remote hacking attacks due to their internet-supported connectivity. Additionally, as they tend to be smaller in size, with reduced computing power, IoT devices often are unable to effectively integrate advanced firewalls or antivirus software.

The combination of a large, vulnerable attack surface via the internet, and the dependence of many companies increasing the potential damage a security breach could have, make IoT devices a common and appealing target for hackers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Goals
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall Goal: To investigage security vulnerabilies in IoT devices. Develop methods that can be used to effectively attack them. Then use these attacks to develop a better way to secure IoT devices.

Individual Goals
1. Determine common security weaknesses for IoT devices
2. Investigate existing security testing hardware/software
3. Test existing tools against IoT devices and determine if it is possible to replicate attacks
4. Design a hardware/software package that provides the functionality of one of these tools and test it
5. Determine possible ways prevent attacks by securing the IoT device
